_Component to integrate with [homee][homee]._
![grafik][homee_logo]

Based on the intial work of [FreshlyBrewedCode]

# Homee is now part of Home Assistant Core!

Please use the built in integration, as this one is not actively developed any more.
V4.0.0 is the final version.

I will continue the Wiki, to track the status of device support.
